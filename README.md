ColourClock
===========

Tell the time with colours that change as they rotate round the clock face.

An animated clock using colours. Blobs at the end of the hour, minute, and second regions change colours over time
(red = 12, yellow = 3, green = 6, blue = 9).

My idea was that this might help younger children to tell the time without having to know what numbers mean (e.g. it's
yellow and orange).

I have also implemented a sine-wave second "tick", and stuck the minute hand to integer positions. This makes the clock a
bit more interesting, because each hand tells the time in a different way.
